# PowerGridMARL
PowerGridMARL is first and foremost a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmarking tool built on Meta's BenchMARL tool. It allows for command-line or in-script MARL experimentation and benchmarking on a variety of promising MARL training algorithms on common MARL training environments AS WELL AS electric distribution grids with controllable infrastructure such as PV inverters, energy storage systems, and EV charging. The distribution grid environments run on NREL's PowerGridworld, making it easy to model distribution grids of all sizes and topologies, with controllable DER's located at any bus in the system.
